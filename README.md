## Rebuilding Green Environment
Most essential goal in this world is to achieve sustainable pollution free green environment.
This goal can only materialise through the **education of mass population**,
   and the **collaboration of the people for the environment related events**.

## Motivation

We are committed to pursue our vision of "restoring the environment
to its previous lustrous green state", wherein each part of
the EcoSystem thrived to its eminence.
- To reach closer to our goal we have developed a non-profit business model to transpire the beneficent changes, that will help us to restore our surroundings and the habitat loss which has manifested in the past decades.
- We hope that our efforts will bring out positive changes, and transcend at further many folds.
