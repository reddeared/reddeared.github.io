            Most people think we should have some concern for future generations,
            but this obvious sounding idea can leadto a surprising conclusion.
            <br/>
            Since the future might be very long, there could be far more people in future generations than in the present generation.
            This means that if you want to make the world better in 
            an impartial way — i.e. without regard to people’s race, class, or where or when they’re born —
            then what most matters morally is that the future goes as well as it can for all generations to come.
            We’ve called this the ‘long-term value thesis.’

            Throughout the world, people want the same things: access to clean air and water;
            economic opportunities; a safe and healthy place to raise their kids; shelter; lifelong learning;
            a sense of community; and the ability to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives.
            <br/>
            A sustainable community takes into account, and addresses, multiple human needs,
            not just one at the exclusion of all others. It is a place where people of diverse backgrounds
            and perspectives feel welcome and safe, where every group has a seat at the decision-making table,
            and where prosperity is shared.

            India needs to adopt a regional air quality management framework as cities alone cannot meet their clean air targets
            if the regional influence of the airshed is not minimised, the CSE emphasised in the review.
            <br/>
            On the occasion of the UN International Day of Clean Air for the blue sky,
            the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has warned that air has no boundaries -
            because of this, clean air action plans that draw hard boundaries around cities for
            the clean-up job are failing to address the major pollution sources in the larger orbit.
            They are fighting a losing battle, even as pollution from the larger airshed continues to invade
            and undermine local efforts.

            It’s the 2030s. Through bold decisions and inventive technologies, three cities have reached the ambitious climate goals
            they set a decade earlier. From bike highways to fish lifts, here’s what urban life looks like in the age of kept promises.
            We picked three cities transforming their cityscapes and living conditions right now – and imagined what life would look
            like if they played out their pioneering pledges in areas such as water management, energy, and material infrastructure.
            <br/>
            Essen becomes a glistening oasis with hi-tech hidden everywhere. "We’re moving away from drainage systems made of concrete
            and replacing them with infrastructures that mimic natural processes." How can Essen bridge the gap between now and the future?
            What else is going on in 2030s Essen?
