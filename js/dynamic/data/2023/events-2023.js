    "description": "Plant trees in Karnataka to bring more rain showers in the state. Scanty rainfall and lack of sufficient water resources in Karnataka have made its agriculture face several crisis, resulting an increased rate of farmer suicides. To mitigate these complications, SankalpTaru is actively planting varied fruit-bearing and native plant species on the lands of marginal farmers in Karnataka. The initiative is active towards sustaining rural livelihood, overcoming the fluctuations in biotic pressures and aiding agricultural practices along with increased water table levels.",
